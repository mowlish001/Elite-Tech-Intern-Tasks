 Task 1: Loan Approval Prediction Model
This project implements a machine learning model using Scikit-learn to predict loan approval status based on applicant details. The dataset includes features like income, CIBIL score, loan amount, assets, employment status, and more. After preprocessing, label encoding, and feature scaling, the data is trained using three classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The models are evaluated based on accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports. A bar chart visually compares the performance of all three models. Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy among them. The project also includes a user-interaction feature, where custom applicant data can be input to predict loan approval in real time. The entire pipeline, from data cleaning to deployment, is implemented in a single Jupyter notebook. This project demonstrates a real-world classification use case and showcases model evaluation, user interaction, and feature analysis. It serves as an excellent beginner-level ML application for loan risk assessment.

 Task 2: AI Chatbot Using NLP
This AI chatbot is built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Python, designed to answer college-related queries. The bot uses a structured intents.json dataset with predefined tags, patterns, and responses. The chatbot preprocesses user queries using tokenization and lemmatization and applies TF-IDF vectorization combined with cosine similarity to find the most relevant response. It supports conversation on topics like college timings, courses offered, fees, hostel, placements, and more. The chatbot is entirely rule-based and works via a command-line interface, allowing users to interact naturally by typing questions. If no close match is found, the bot politely prompts for clarification. This project demonstrates how NLP can be integrated with simple machine learning techniques to build a functional chatbot. It's lightweight, easy to expand, and great for educational institutes or beginner NLP enthusiasts. The system is modular and can be further improved by adding GUI or deploying it as a web app.

 Task 3: Weather Report and PDF Generator
This project is a Python-based weather data analysis and PDF report generation system for Bangalore's 2024 climate. It uses the Open-Meteo API to fetch historical weather data, including temperature, rainfall, and wind speed. The data is analyzed using pandas and visualized using seaborn and matplotlib to generate line plots, bar charts, box plots, and histograms. Users can input a specific date to get detailed weather information for that day. Summary statistics like average temperature, total rainfall, and wind speed are calculated and presented in the final report. All visualizations and stats are compiled into a polished PDF using the fpdf library. The PDF includes a title page, annual summary, user-specified date details, and embedded visual plots. This task showcases data collection, analysis, visualization, and report automation in one integrated project. Itâ€™s ideal for developers and students interested in combining data science with real-world document generation and API usage.
